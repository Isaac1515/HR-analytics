HR analytics - AtliQ Grands Company 

This project aims to facilitate the HR team at AtliQ with valuable insights into employee behaviour and preferences, enhancing productivity. Through the implementation of a comprehensive dashboard, we have valuable KPIs at a glance. Some of the ones in this project are:- 

- WFH (Work from Home)
- SL Count (Sick Leave Count)
- P (Present)
- HP (Half Pay Leave)
- PL (Pay Leave)
- WO (Weekly Off)
- HO (Holiday Off)

By leveraging these insights, the HR team can tailor their strategies and initiatives to create an environment that maximizes employee engagement and productivity.

- Created Dax measure to calculate the percentage of work-from-home (WFH) count. This measure provides insights into the proportion of employees opting for remote work arrangements. 

- Created DAX measure to calculate the percentage of employee presence. This measure will help in determining the proportion of employees who are currently present in the workplace. By utilizing this measure, AtliQ can gain valuable insights into the attendance patterns within the organization, enabling them to analyze workforce dynamics and make informed decisions

- Created a DAX measure to calculate the percentage of sick leave count. This measure will enable us to understand the proportion of employees taking sick leave with respect to the total workforce. By utilizing this measure, we can gain insights into absenteeism trends, which can help us identify patterns, address potential issues, and implement strategies to support employee well-being.
